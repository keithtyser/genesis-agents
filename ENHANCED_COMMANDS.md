# Enhanced Command System Documentation

## Overview

The enhanced command system dramatically expands agent expressiveness and innovation capabilities by adding 10+ new verbs, conditional logic, skill systems, and sophisticated object interactions.

## New Core Verbs

### Knowledge & Skills
- **`TEACH <agent> <skill>`** - Transfer skills or knowledge to other agents
- **`LEARN <skill> [FROM <agent>]`** - Acquire new skills, optionally from a teacher
- **`ANALYZE <object>`** - Study objects to gain detailed knowledge

### Object Interaction
- **`COMBINE <obj1> AND <obj2> [INTO <result>]`** - Merge objects to create new items
- **`USE <object> [ON <target>]`** - Utilize tools and objects functionally  
- **`MODIFY <object> <property>=<value>`** - Alter object properties
- **`INSPECT <object>`** - Examine objects in detail
- **`DESTROY <object>`** - Remove unwanted objects

### Innovation & Discovery
- **`EXPERIMENT WITH <items...>`** - Test combinations for random discoveries
- **`TRADE <item> FOR <item> WITH <agent>`** - Exchange resources with other agents

### Advanced Logic
- **`IF <condition> THEN <action>`** - Conditional execution based on world state
- **`DEFINE <verb> AS <template>`** - Create custom macro commands

## Conditional Logic System

### Supported Conditions
- **`HAS <object>`** - Check if agent owns a specific object type
- **`location=<value>`** - Check agent's current location  
- **`EXISTS <object>`** - Check if object type exists anywhere in world

### Examples
```
WORLD: IF HAS axe THEN CREATE shelter
WORLD: IF location=forest THEN GATHER berries  
WORLD: IF EXISTS fire THEN COOK food
```

## Skill & Knowledge Systems

### Skill Development
- Agents can learn skills through `LEARN` command
- Skills are automatically gained when using tools (`USE` command)
- Skills can be shared between agents via `TEACH`
- Skills persist in agent data and influence capabilities

### Knowledge Base
- Agents build knowledge through `ANALYZE` and `INSPECT` commands
- Knowledge can be shared via `TEACH` command
- Stored as key-value pairs in agent data

## Object Interaction Enhancements

### Combination System
```
WORLD: COMBINE stone AND wood INTO axe
WORLD: COMBINE berries AND water INTO juice
```
- Creates new objects from existing materials
- Tracks component history and creation metadata
- Enables complex tool and resource creation

### Usage Tracking
```
WORLD: USE hammer ON nail
WORLD: USE fishing_rod
```
- Tracks object usage frequency
- Automatically develops related skills
- Enables tool specialization and expertise

### Experimentation
```
WORLD: EXPERIMENT WITH leaves stone water
```
- 30% chance of discovering new objects
- Encourages creative material combination
- Drives innovation through trial and error

## Custom Macro System

### Creating Macros
```
WORLD: DEFINE GATHER AS CREATE ${arg1}
WORLD: DEFINE HUNT AS COMBINE spear AND skill INTO ${arg1}
```

### Using Macros
```
WORLD: GATHER berries
WORLD: HUNT deer
```

### Macro Benefits
- Reduces command complexity for frequent actions
- Enables agent workflow optimization
- Supports hierarchical action composition

## Agent Prompt Enhancements

Both Adam and Eve now have:
- Comprehensive verb documentation in their system prompts
- Encouragement to use advanced features like conditionals and experimentation
- Role-specific guidance (Eve: exploration/innovation, Adam: building/organization)
- Emphasis on knowledge sharing and cooperation

## Innovation Incentives

### Built-in Discovery Mechanisms
1. **Random Experimentation** - `EXPERIMENT` has chance-based discovery
2. **Skill Progression** - Using tools develops expertise
3. **Knowledge Accumulation** - Analysis builds understanding
4. **Collaborative Learning** - Teaching spreads innovation

### Complexity Enablers
1. **Conditional Logic** - Smart decision making
2. **Macro Creation** - Workflow optimization  
3. **Object Combination** - Complex tool creation
4. **Resource Trading** - Economic cooperation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Innovation Workflow
```
WORLD: CREATE stone
WORLD: CREATE wood  
WORLD: COMBINE stone AND wood INTO axe
WORLD: USE axe ON tree
WORLD: ANALYZE axe
WORLD: TEACH Adam toolmaking
```

### Advanced Logic Example
```
WORLD: IF HAS wood AND HAS stone THEN COMBINE wood AND stone INTO shelter
WORLD: IF location=river THEN CREATE fishing_rod
WORLD: DEFINE BUILD AS IF HAS ${arg1} THEN CREATE ${arg2}
WORLD: BUILD wood house
```

### Collaborative Discovery
```
Adam: WORLD: EXPERIMENT WITH clay water
Adam: WORLD: TEACH Eve pottery  
Eve: WORLD: LEARN pottery FROM Adam
Eve: WORLD: COMBINE pottery AND fire INTO kiln
```

## Impact on Innovation

### Before Enhancement
- Limited to 4 basic verbs (CREATE, MOVE, SET, BREED)
- No object interactions or combinations
- No skill development or knowledge sharing
- No conditional logic or complex behaviors

### After Enhancement  
- 14+ expressive verbs enabling complex behaviors
- Conditional logic for intelligent decision making
- Skill and knowledge systems driving expertise development
- Object combination and experimentation fostering innovation
- Custom macros enabling workflow optimization
- Resource trading promoting cooperation

This enhancement transforms the simulation from a basic conversation system into a rich environment where agents can genuinely innovate, learn, teach, and build complex societies through meaningful interactions.
