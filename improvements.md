1. Limited Action Space & Expressiveness
Current Problem: The command vocabulary is extremely restrictive (only 4 core verbs). This severely limits agents' ability to innovate or create complex behaviors.
Recommendations:
Expand core verbs: Add TEACH, LEARN, TRADE, DESTROY, COMBINE, ANALYZE, EXPERIMENT
Implement hierarchical actions: Allow agents to create custom macros that combine multiple primitives
Add conditional logic: Support IF/THEN constructs in commands
Enable object interaction: Commands to USE, MODIFY, INSPECT existing objects

2. Shallow World State & Physics
Current Problem: Objects are just key-value pairs with no relationships, properties, or interactions.
Recommendations:
Add object dependencies: Tools require materials, buildings need foundations
Implement resource constraints: Scarcity drives innovation and cooperation
Create spatial relationships: Distance affects interactions, movement costs
Add temporal effects: Objects decay, skills improve with practice, seasons change

3. Weak Innovation Incentives
Current Problem: Agents have no pressure to innovate or evolve beyond basic conversation.
Recommendations:
Survival challenges: Introduce periodic threats requiring tool/strategy creation
Resource competition: Limited materials force creative solutions
Knowledge gaps: Present problems that require multiple agents to solve
Discovery rewards: Give benefits for creating novel object combinations

4. Breeding System Limitations
Current Problem: Offspring only inherit temperature and basic trait descriptionsâ€”no behavioral or knowledge evolution.
Recommendations:
Skill inheritance: Children inherit subsets of parent knowledge/abilities
Genetic programming: Combine parent prompt templates more sophisticatedly
Mutation mechanisms: Random variations in child personalities/goals
Generational learning: Each generation builds on previous knowledge

1. Progressive Complexity
Start simple but add layers:
Phase 1: Basic survival (food, shelter)
Phase 2: Tool creation and specialization
Phase 3: Social structures and cooperation
Phase 4: Knowledge preservation and teaching
