"""
sandbox.breeding ‚Äì listens for reciprocal BREED requests and spawns child agents.

Rules
-----
‚Ä¢ A parent issues {"type":"breed_request","parent":P,"partner":Q,"tick":t}
‚Ä¢ If Q issues the symmetric request in *the same tick t*, spawn exactly one child
‚Ä¢ Child name format:  child_<tick>_<P[:3]>_<Q[:3]>_<4hex>
‚Ä¢ Child system_msg combines parent traits; temperature = avg(parent temps)
